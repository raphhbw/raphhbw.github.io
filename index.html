								<b>Education:</b> <br> PhD of Physics & Astronomy at University of Exeter <br> MSc by Research in Physics at University of Warwick
								<br> BSc in Physics at University of Warwick
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b> <br> Structure of debris discs, planet-disc interactions, exocomet transit detection, debris disc observations
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Other Interests:</b><br>
								Other than my interest in Astronomy, I have been playing basketball competitively for 15 years in national/county/university leagues. 
								From 2017 to 2022, I have been involved in the Warwick Basketball Club, taking different positions as the years go by 
								(Charity Officer 2018-2019, Men's Teams Captain 2020-2021, Advisor to the Executive Commitee 2021-2022). 
								I was also a Warwick Sport Activator, encouraging other students to be more active, by running casual, inclusive and beginner 
								friendly basketball sessions.<br>
								My growing experience in data manipulation has strengthened my interest in sport data science, especially linked to basketball. 
								On the side, I am familiarising myself with new analytic tools more specialised towards sports analytics 
								(<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/sports-analytics#courses" target="_blank">Coursera course</a> if interested). 
								Some of my personal side projects include trying to predict the winning team of future basketball seasons according to old data, 
								or predicting future MVP/ROY according to archival data.<br>
								I have always been fascinated by the marine environment, with experience working in the yachting industry, as well as my continual 
								enthusiasm to discover the underwater world (scuba diving, freediving, spear fishing).

								<b>Direct Imaging of planets around HD107146, HD92945, HD206893 </b><br>
								<i>Project supervisor: Sebastian Marino</i><br>
								<img src="images/seba_project1.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:auto;"/><br>
								This project aims to study the structure of the debris dics of these 3 stars that were previously discovered with ALMA
								(Marino et al. 2018, 2019, 2020). These debris discs are seen to have gaps that suggest the presence of planet-disc interactions
								where Neptune-like planets could carve such observed annular gaps. With JWST MIRI data we aim to detect these gap carving planets
								and when combined with the disc structure information, we will be able to constrain both the orbits and dynamical history of these systems.

								<b>Automated Search for Spectroscopic Exocomet Transits</b><br>
								<i>Project supervisor: Grant Kennedy, Paul Strøm, David Brown</i><br>
								<img src="images/asset.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:auto;"/><br>
								As part of my masters, we developed an automated pipeline that searches for signs of exocomet transits in spectroscopy data.
								Being guided by the multiple exocomet transits detected around the archetypal star Beta Pictoris, exocomets can be identified by
								transient absorption features in specific atomic species, such as the commonly used ionised Calcium doublet. The aim of this project
								is to overcome the typical bias towards sample of stars with detected debris discs (increasing the chance of detecting exocomets), and
								evaluate the occurrence rate of exocomet transits + determine any trends in host stars using a large and more diverse sample of stars,
								ie. the entire HARPS archive. Paper in prep.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Self-Organising Map (Summer project)</b><br>
								This summer project introduced me to an unsupervised Machine Learning classification algorithm called a Self-Organising Map (SOM) 
								that we used to classify stellar spectra according to their different spectral shapes. This was an attempt to reduce the 
								number of false positive detections in our search for exocomet transits. The main idea is that stars showing similar features,
								eg. variable stellar activity, would be classified together, providing an easier method to identify and filter specific sources 
								of false positive exocomet detections.
